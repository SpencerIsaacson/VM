things to implement:
push blocks, torches, chests
doors, locked doors, shop, signs, octorocks, shield, jumping over gaps, climbing up ledges
you will need triangle rendering, meshes, particles, skeletal animation,

After work today, I need to implement a) basic triangle rasterization b) generalize drawing to have a "global texture"
so that you can switch from drawing to the screen to drawing into sprites, texture maps, etc.

Once you have basic triangle rasteriztion in place, you need to add a basic 3d transform pipeline.

Then do terrain (including collision). Then do animation (you don't necessarily need a complete animation system, possibly just some basic lerps and easing functions),

Then start working on making prettier assets

All right, back to work, we got the basic rasterizer in place, so this evening do the "global texture" and get back to terrain generation (and adding terrain collision) CHECK
